# Monster Money Maze

This is a simple game to be played on a text terminal. You find your way through
a maze, picking up cash before exiting at the bottom right. You must avoid
bumping into the monsters wandering randomly through the maze. The goal is to
leave with as much money as possible, but the longer you stay, the more monsters
appear, so be careful!

More information is available through the in-game menus.

## Compatibility

The code can be compiled with a C89 compiler and a Curses library. The code
works on Windows using PDCurses. To run the program, you should probably have a
terminal with dimensions of at least 80x24 that distinguishes uppercase and
lowercase letters.
